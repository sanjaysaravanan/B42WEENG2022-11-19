Concepts:
  while loop: while is used as entry controlled loop
    incremental while
    decremental while

  different ways add elements into an array:
    using index
    built methods
      push ->  Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
      pop  -> Removes the last element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
  
  switch case: multiple cases can be checked

  frequency of number/chars in array or string

  Prime Number

  built-in methods to reverse array ---> arr.reverse(); // modifies and reverses the array
  built-in methods to string --> toUpperCase, toLowerCase


Next Session:
  Array Reverse
  Area of a Rectangle ( round-off n 1 decimal place )
  Leap Year or not
  Leap Year ---> O/P: LEAP
  Non Leap Year ---> O/P: COMMON

  String:
    1. Reverse a String
    2. Palindrome
